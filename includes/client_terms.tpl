		<p><strong>Many accidents that may occur in relation to activities on site can be avoided if the advice given in this booklet is followed. We feel sure that your employees will appreciate working on <?=$brand;?> Managed Sites where a high priority is given to health, safety and environmental issues, and will respect our wishes in all of these matters.</strong></p>
		<h2>Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015</h2>

		<p>Please note that the CDM 2015 regulations now apply to ALL construction and maintenance projects regardless of the size, duration and nature of the work. Routine maintenance work will, therefore, not necessarily be exempt from the regulations.</p>

		<p>As part of this Purchase Order, <?=$brand;?> request that you inform us at the outset if the work is likely to be judged as <strong>'Construction Work'</strong> as defined in the regulations. The HSE has also advised the following regarding maintenance;<br /></p>

		<p>"The definition of maintenance work has not changed. If the task in hand looks like construction work, requires construction skills and uses construction materials, it is construction work. General maintenance of fixed plant which mainly involves mechanical adjustments, replacing parts or lubrication is unlikely to be construction work".<br /></p>

		<p>Please note that CDM 2015 places a legal responsibility on our Client to ensure a suitable <strong>Construction Phase Plan (CPP)</strong> is drawn up for all 'construction work'-related projects both notifiable and non-notifiable (to the HSE). The Plan should be proportionate and risk-based with the content being representative of the nature and extent of the project.<br /></p>

		<p>Please be aware that although it is the Client's responsibility to ensure a CPP is in place before the project commences it is your duty, as the appointed contractor, to produce the Plan if you deem the work you are about to undertake as being 'Construction work'.<br /></p>

		<p>For single contractor projects the CPP should be prepared by the contractor and forwarded to <a href="mailto:contractors@<?=$domain;?>">contractors@<?=$domain;?></a>. <?=$brand;?> recommend that contractor staff consider using the CDM Wizard App which is designed to make it easier for small businesses to prepare themselves for the CDM Regulations. The App is available to download <a href="https://www.citb.co.uk/about-citb/partnerships-and-initiatives/construction-design-and-management-cdm-regulations/cdm-wizard-app/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /></p>

		<p>For projects involving more than 1 contractor, the Client must appoint (in writing) a Principal Designer and Principal Contractor who must take the lead in terms of preparing the CPP for the Client. The Client has a responsibility during this phase to ensure that a CPP is drawn up before the construction site is set up. The Principal Designer has a duty to provide any relevant information to assist the Principal Contractor in producing the CPP.<br /></p>

		<p>For those contractors that do not have access to smart phone/tablet technology <?=$brand;?> has devised a PDF version of the CPP for contractors to complete and return to <?=$brand;?>/our client prior to the commencement of works. <a href="#documents">Download</a> the PDF version of the CPP and return to <a href="mailto:contractors@<?=$domain;?>">contractors@<?=$domain;?></a>.<br /></p>

		<h2>Gates & Roller Shutters<br /></h2>
		<p>It is important that for attendance to any gates or roller shutters, either instructed by the Contractors Team or the Property Manager, that a report is subsequently provided to the Contractors Team. Where there is an issue with the gate, which cannot be resolved and is unsafe to leave in operation, we require you to isolate the gate in the open position and send a notification into <a href="mailto:contractors@<?=$domain;?>">contractors@<?=$domain;?></a>. This notification should also detail the risk that would be presented in leaving this gate in operation and the required works with costs to return it to a safe working condition. Failure to comply with this instruction may result in further action being taken.
		</p>

		<h2>Working At Height<br /></h2>
		<p>All contractor staff are to note that the Working At Height Regulations (WAHR) 2005 applies to all work at height whenever there is a risk of a fall likely to cause injury. As part of the WAHR duty holders, including employers of contractor staff, must:<br /></p>

		<ul><li>Carry out a formal risk assessment</li><li>Ensure all work at height is properly planned, organised and takes into account weather conditions</li><li>Ensure those involved in work at height are trained and competent</li><li>Ensure equipment for work at height is appropriately inspected and records maintained</li><li>Ensure risks associated with fragile surfaces are properly controlled</li>
		<li>All contractor staff are to ensure that the legal duties outlined above are adhered to and that no work is undertaken at height if it is reasonably practicable to do it in another, safer, way.<br /></li></ul>

		<h2>Gas Safety (Regulation 8) <br /></h2>
		<p>The purpose of this Gas Safety guidance is to ensure that contractors are aware of the gas safety implications when undertaking work to property. Carrying out alterations, decoration and/or refurbishments to property may affect the safety of existing gas installations and appliances â€¦.these works may include, but not limited to: <br /></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Window Replacements</li>
			<li>Cavity Wall Insulation</li>
			<li>Replacement of Ventilation</li>
			<li>Fitting Extract Fans</li>
			<li>Reducing Chimney Heights</li>
			<li>Enclosing an Existing Flue / Appliance</li>
			<li>Building Extensions</li>
			<li>Installing External / Internal Cladding</li>
			<li>Extending Existing Flues</li>
			<li>Conversions from Flat to Pitched Roofs</li>
			<li>Roofing  works</li>
			<li>Rooms Converted to Sleeping Accommodation</li>
			<li>Installing kitchens and bathrooms</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Before a significant alteration is made to properties where a gas appliance, installation or flue way is installed any implications for the gas appliance and/or installation safety need to be properly addressed. You need to demonstrate that you have exercised due diligence prior to, and during the work process, and that you have an adequate record for each step in that process.
		</p>
		<p><strong>NB Although Regulation 8 applies to gas appliances/installations, the same principles shall be applied to other fossil fuel burning appliances, i.e. solid fuel or oil.</strong></p>
		<p>The works must be undertaken with due regard to the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998. Regulation 8. Existing Gas Fittings.<br/></p>

		<p><strong><u>Regulation 8(1) Existing gas fittings, states:</u></strong></p>
		<p><strong>No person shall make any alterations to any premises in which a gas fitting or gas storage vessel is fitted if that alteration would adversely affect the safety of the fitting or vessel in such a manner that, if the fitting or vessel had been installed after the alteration, there would have been a contravention of, or failure to comply with, these regulations.' </strong></p>
		<p>This regulation embraces a wide range of physical alterations to premises that may affect the safety of an existing gas fitting or installed in the premises where the alteration is to be made. Before a significant alteration is made to premises where gas appliances are installed, e.g. installation or removal of windows, air bricks, extract fan units etc, any implications for gas appliances/fittings safety need to be properly addressed. Similarly, prior consideration needs to be given to the possible effect of any modification, such as a building extension, on the safety of gas storage vessel (e.g. from any reduction in separation distances and standards of ventilation), or on service pipework (e.g. the risk of damage to buried pipework from strain/weight imposed upon it).</p>

		<p><br/><strong><u>Regulation 8(2) Existing gas fittings, states:</u></strong></p>
		<p><strong>No person shall do anything which would affect a gas fitting or flue or means of ventilation used in connection with the fitting in such a manner that the subsequent use of the fitting might constitute a danger to any person, except that this paragraph does not apply to an alteration to premises.</strong></p>
		<p>This regulation applies to everyone, not just gas installers. It supplements regulation 8(1), by prohibiting other activities (i.e. except alterations to premises) which have potential to compromise safety; this may for instance include modifications which cause blockage/obstruction of an air supply vent or flue. As in regulation 8(1), it is essential for the implications of such change or modification to be properly addressed, before work is commenced, to ensure that gas safety cannot be prejudiced in any way.</p>
		<p>Modification of any gas fitting should be made only by a competent person who is, or is employed by, a Gas Safe registered company. Alterations not comprising â€˜workâ€™ on a gas fitting but which nevertheless may affect gas safety, e.g. a change to room ventilation provisions, should also be made only by a person with the required competence. Similarly, any significant modification needs to be checked by a person before the gas fitting concerned is taken into use, to ensure that appropriate standards have been met and safety has not been compromised.</p>

		<p><br/><strong><u>Regulation 8(3) Existing gas fittings, states:</u></strong></p>
		<p><strong>In relation to any place of work under his control, an employer or self-employed person shall ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) are complied with.</strong></p>
		<p>It is recommended that a responsible person, e.g. a principal contractor, foreman, site manager, supervisor, or other person with overall control of the work, is nominated to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, compliance with regulation 8(1) and 8(2).</p>

		<p><br/><strong><u>Pre Contract Start Survey</u></strong></p>
		<p>Prior to the commencement of any work, either internal or to the external fabric of a building, where gas safety may be affected, the responsible person must arrange for a survey of the property by a suitably trained person or by a Gas Safe registered contractor. The survey must assess all gas appliances, installation and flue-ways belonging to the landlord and tenant within all properties that may be affected by the proposed work, and detail any control measures that may be required.</p>
		<p>Where there is any doubt in the above survey that the proposed works may impact on the continued safety of a gas appliance, flue or installation, and the survey was not carried out by a gas safe registered person, a Gas Safe registered person must be appointed by the contractor and must then undertake these surveys. The operative undertaking these surveys must hold the necessary current competencies under ACS relevant to the appliance / installation types being surveyed. All surveys must be completed in full and signed / dated by the operative undertaking the work and include the companyâ€™s Gas Safe registration number.</p>
		<p>The survey will provide the responsible person with the following information:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>An overview of how the proposed works might affect the safety of the existing gas appliances / flues</li>
			<li>The types of appliance/position within the dwelling. If there are no gas appliances this must be recorded on the survey form.</li>
			<li>The types, positions and current construction of any flues that may be affected by the proposed work, this is to include redundant flues which are in close proximity to the work area and <strong>must be confirmed as redundant on any permit to work.</strong> </li>
			<li>Details of any alterations required to the existing flue-ways to ensure that when the work is complete the flue installation will comply with BS 5440 part1 </li>
			<li>Any method statements required ensuring the ongoing safety of the tenants and the property during the work period. In some circumstances it may require appliances to be disconnected during the alterations and re-commissioned on completion of works. This may be required with works such as such as cladding, roofing or chimney / flue work.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><br/><strong><u>Approval</u></strong></p>
		<p>The survey will require analysis by the Contractor and a suitable and sufficient method statement/safe system of work identified and provided to those carrying out the work. This will be required in order to establish a clear understanding of how the proposed work could affect the existing gas installations and will provide evidence of a proper end to end process employed in the event of external scrutiny.</p>

		<h2>Hand Arm Vibration (HAVs) <br /></h2>
		<p>Vibration exposure from prolonged and regular work with high-vibration hand-held tools can have adverse effects on the hands and arms of users. Without effective controls, workers using such equipment may suffer various forms of damage, collectively known as â€˜hand-arm vibration syndromeâ€™ (HAVS). The most common forms of damage are â€˜vibration white fingerâ€™ (VWF) and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, which are prescribed industrial diseases.</p>
		<p>Contractors must obtain the vibration data before deciding which equipment to hire. With the correct information provided by the supplier, employers must calculate the allowed exposure time for operatives using the equipment, and specify the controls to be implemented to ensure the specified exposure times are not exceeded.</p>
		<p>The HSE provide a vibration calculator and ready-reckoner that can be used to determine whether Exposure Action or Limit Values are likely to be exceeded and should be used to assist in the risk assessment.  This easy to use facility is available via the HSE Website at <a href="http://www.hse.gov/vibration/hav/vibrationcalc.htm" target="_blank">www.hse.gov/vibration/hav/vibrationcalc.htm</a>.</p>
		<h2>Hazardous Substances (COSHH) <br /></h2>
		<p>Chemicals and other substances used on site can affect peopleâ€™s health if the hazards created are not understood and controlled e.g. working in a confined space using solvents can create a harmful concentration of vapours.  Other activities on site can also create health hazards, which must be controlled e.g. chasing, cutting or breaking concrete can cause harmful dust.</p>
		<p>The aim of the COSHH Regulations is to safeguard the health of people using or coming into contact with hazardous substances.  However, to do this the regulations must be followed along with other relevant legislation.<p>
		<p><strong><u>Storage</u></strong></p>
		<p>A trained and competent person should supervise the storage of all chemicals and hazardous substances.  Weekly checks are to be made on the chemicals and the condition of the containers and labels.</p>
		<p><strong><u>Disposal</u></strong></p>
		<p>All unused or waste chemicals and hazardous substances must be disposed of through a licensed waste disposal contractor.</p>
		<h2>Tree Preservation Order (TPO)<br /></h2>
		<p>It is an offence for contractors to carry out any work which may affect trees subject to a TPO without prior permission from the Local Authority.Â  In all circumstances, if the work you have been contracted to undertake will involve the cutting/pruning of trees/branches then you must check with the Local Authority if there is a TPO in place before work commences.<h2>

		<h2>Lift Contracts <br /></h2>
		<p>Maintenance Visits & Reports:</p>
		<p>The first maintenance visit will take place on the contract start date and the auto dialler status will need to be checked.  If it can be reprogrammed this will also need to be done on the first maintenance visit.  If it is closed protocol non-reprogrammable, the engineer will need to inform the <?=$brand;?> property manager immediately.</p>

		<h2>Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (LOLER)</h2>
		<p>RMG approved contractors must ensure that the duties placed on people who operate or have control over lifting equipment and lifting accessories  are followed at all times. In most cases, lifting equipment is also work equipment so the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (PUWER) 1998 will also apply (including inspection and maintenance). As well as Working at Height Regulations (WAHR) 2005 (including assessment of impact of weather conditions and residual risk such as ground conditions, overhead cables and manoeuvrability)</p>
		<p>All lifting operations involving lifting equipment must be</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Properly planned by a competent person</li>
